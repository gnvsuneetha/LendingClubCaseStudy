# LendingClubCaseStudy


Project Brief
Working on this case study will give us an idea about how real business problems are solved using EDA. In this case study, apart from applying the techniques we have learnt in EDA, we will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

Business Understanding
The client is a finance company who specialises in lending various types of loans to customers. When the client receives a loan application, they have to decide on loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is not a potential defaulter, then not approving a loan results in a loss of business to the client

If the applicant isa potential defaulter, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving a loan may lead to a financial loss for the client

The data provided to us is from the past and from the past data wee will try to identify if a loan applicant can be a potential defaulter or not.

While doing this analysis we will use EDA. The initial phase wee will try to under the data we have. Clean up null data. Then clean up existing data which can be easily analysed.

If we can identify if an applicant can be a defaulter or not based on that the number of other checks can be mae before taking a decision on if the loan can be approved to the applicant or not.
